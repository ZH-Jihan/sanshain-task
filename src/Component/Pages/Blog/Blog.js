            <h3>1. How will you improve the performance of a React Application?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer :</strong>
            JavInternally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of
                  costly DOM operations required to update the UI. For many applications, using
                  React will lead to a fast user interface without doing much work to
                  specifically optimize for performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways
                  you can speed up your React application.aScript
                  <br /> 1. Keeping component state local where necessary.
                <br /> 2. Memoizing React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
                <br /> 3. Code-splitting in React using dynamic import()
                <br /> 4. Windowing or list virtualization in React.
                <br /> 5. Lazy loading images in React.

            <h3>2. What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Answer :</strong>
              There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React
                  apps:<br />
                1 Local state. <br />2 Global state.
                <br />
                3 Server state.
                <br /> 4 URL state.

            <h3>3. How does prototypical inheritance work?</h3>
            <p>
            <strong>Answer : The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and
                  properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the
                  properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and
                  set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.
                  Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal and hidden
                  property known as [[Prototype]]. The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in
                  javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by
                  which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
                  Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use
                  Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern
                  language, it is being set using __proto__.</strong><br /> br If you update it directly, calling the setState() afterward may just
                replace the update you made. When you directly update the state, it does not
                change this.state immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition,
                and accessing it after calling this method will only return the present value.
                You will lose control of the state across all components.

            <h3>4. What is a unit test?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer : Unit testing is a type of testing in which individual units or functions of
                  software testing. Its primary purpose is to test each unit or function. A
                  unit is the smallest testable part of an application. It mainly has one or a
                  few inputs and produces a single output.</strong></p>

            <h3>5. Why should write unit tests?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer :</strong> Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before it's
                  deployed. This ensures a reliable engineering environment where quality is
                  paramount. Over the course of the product development life cycle, unit
                  testing saves time and money, and helps developers write better code, more
                  efficiently</p>
